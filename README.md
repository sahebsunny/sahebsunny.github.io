Hello! Thanks for checking out the repo for my portfolio website. This website isn't just my new portfolio, but also a personal project in and of itself. I think I've grown quite a bit as a developer in the past year, so I wanted to create something to showcase some of what I've learned and done.

I value keeping my site open source, but as you all know, plagiarism is bad. It's always disheartening whenever I find that someone has copied my site without giving me credit. I spent a non-trivial amount of effort building and designing this iteration of my website, and I am proud of it! All I ask of you all is to not claim this effort as your own.
